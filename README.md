# LnzLive

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

[Edit and preview LNZ files in your browser!](https://mnemoli.github.io/LnzLive/export/index.html)

**Currently limited to desktop browsers.**

## Instructions

See the [usage guide](GUIDE.md).

## Limitations

Some browsers have security restrictions that won't let you paste into the LNZ text box. Chrome-based browsers are more likely to work. [Download the EXE](https://github.com/mnemoli/LnzLive/releases) instead if you're having trouble.

This app is in development. Expect crashes and visual bugs.

If you would like to help with development, raise [an issue](https://github.com/mnemoli/LnzLive/issues) (as long as it's not covered above) or a pull request.
